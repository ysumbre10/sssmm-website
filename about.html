    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Shree Swami Samarth Mitra Mandal was established on 13 June 2003 with a mission to unite the community through devotion and service. Starting with a small group of dedicated devotees, we have now grown into a large family committed to preserving and spreading cultural and spiritual values.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of our mandal is to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with grandeur and devotion while engaging in various charitable and social welfare activities throughout the year. We aim to inspire the younger generation to uphold our traditions and serve society selflessly.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Members</h2>
    <p>
      Our mandal consists of enthusiastic and dedicated members who work tirelessly to organize events and activities. The core committee includes President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, and multiple volunteers who contribute in planning, decorations, cultural programs, and community services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each member plays an important role, and we welcome everyone who wishes to join our mission and serve with devotion and love.
